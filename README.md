 To-Do-List-CLI-App

## Description:
This is a simple yet efficient command-line To-Do List application built using Python. The application enables users to manage their tasks effortlessly, allowing them to add new tasks, delete existing ones, and mark tasks as completed. The program ensures persistent storage by saving tasks to a text file (tasks.txt), so users can retain their to-do list even after restarting the application.

This project is beginner-friendly, providing a great way to practice object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and user interaction via the command line.

## Features:
-> View All Tasks: Displays all pending and completed tasks in a well-formatted list.
-> Add New Tasks: Allows users to add new tasks to their to-do list.
-> Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks by selecting the corresponding number.
-> Mark Tasks as Completed: Completed tasks are visually distinguished from pending ones.
-> Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in a text file (tasks.txt) to ensure they are not lost between sessions.
-> Simple and Lightweight: No external libraries required—just pure Python.

## How It Works:
Run the script using Python:
python to-do-list.py

Choose an option from the menu:

1 → View all tasks
2 → Add a new task
3 → Delete a task
4 → Mark a task as completed
5 → Exit the application
The application automatically saves changes to tasks.txt, ensuring task persistence.

## Tech Stack:
Language: Python
Storage: Text file (tasks.txt) for data persistence

## Future Improvements:
-> Add a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt.
-> Implement task due dates and prioritization.
-> Use SQLite or JSON for improved data management.
-> Add notifications/reminders for pending tasks.
